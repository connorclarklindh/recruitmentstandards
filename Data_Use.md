Outline -
Job seekers should have full control of their data. They should know when and how that data is used and be able to "retract" permission to use their data when desired.
Recruiters and Companies can retain a "Trace" of that data to know that the person was once a candidate and removed their data, but besides the trace they should not retain any additional data.
Job seekers should know how their data is being "enhanced" through API pulls from tools like clearbit and fullcontact and have equal access to this enhanced data.
Job seekers should know what annoynmus analysis is being done on their data and related data. Simply by needing to make this disclosure companies will be more careful about how they use and analyize candidate data.
